If you want to read more about my setup, I made a blog post that details my reasoning a bit better. You can read it [here](http://owen.cymru/hjkl-all-the-things/).

My `~/.vimrc` is focussed on being able to be (for the most part) standalone and auto installing. This means that when you work on a new host all that is needed to do to replicate my local setup is to curl the vimrc to my home directory and launch Vim.
